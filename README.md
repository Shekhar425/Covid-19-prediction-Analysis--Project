# Covid-19-prediction-Analysis--Project

1.Problem Statement: 
Given data about COVID-19 patients, write code to visualize the impact and 
analyse the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make 
predictions about the number of cases expected a week in future based on 
the current trends.

2. Data Preprocessing Steps and Inspiration: 
The data preprocessing steps followed were: 
1. Importing required libraries: Necessary libraries for data analysis and 
modelling were imported. 
2. Data Loading and Exploration: The data was loaded using read_csv 
(.zip) and an initial exploration was conducted to understand the data 
structure and variable descriptions. 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed, basically data 
cleaning and renaming of few columns done to simplify analysis steps. 
Inspiration: Correlation metrics indicates positive and high correlation among 
few features made features selection and further steps more helpful.
